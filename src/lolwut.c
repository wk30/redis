/* Draw a square centered at the specified x,y coordinates, with the specified
 * rotation angle and size. In order to write a rotated square, we use the
 * trivial fact that the parametric equation:
 *
 *  x = sin(k)
 *  y = cos(k)
 *
 * Describes a circle for values going from 0 to 2*PI. So basically if we start
 * at 45 degrees, that is k = PI/4, with the first point, and then we find
 * the other three points incrementing K by PI/2 (90 degrees), we'll have the
 * points of the square. In order to rotate the square, we just start with
 * k = PI/4 + rotation_angle, and we are done.
 *
 * Of course the vanilla equations above will describe the square inside a
 * circle of radius 1, so in order to draw larger squares we'll have to
 * multiply the obtained coordinates, and then translate them. However this
 * is much simpler than implementing the abstract concept of 2D shape and then
 * performing the rotation/translation transformation, so for LOLWUT it's
 * a good approach. */
